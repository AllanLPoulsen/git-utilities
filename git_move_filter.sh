#   The `--prune-empty` with `git filter-branch` brings over commits from **ONLY** the other repo which involves the directory being moved.

#   describes git filter-branch as rewrite revision history what is specifically mentioned after `--subdirectory-filter`.
#   The `â€“-` (two dashes) separates paths from revisions.
#   An example of the response (where "folderA1" is replaced with your folder name):
# Sample response: 
#           Rewrite ce91108524893c98adae9a4db9fbeebdec2affbe (21/21)
