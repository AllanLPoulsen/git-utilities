echo "STEP 03: List files caz the next action promotes files in the directory up to the project root level:"

#   The `--prune-empty` with `git filter-branch` brings over commits from **ONLY** the other repo which involves the directory being moved.
#   The official doc at https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch
#   describes git filter-branch as rewrite revision history what is specifically mentioned after `--subdirectory-filter`.
#   The `â€“-` (two dashes) separates paths from revisions.
#   An example of the response (where "directory 1" is replaced with your folder name):
